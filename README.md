My first prototype in Unity, inspired by 'Sheep, Dog and Wolf' PS1 game. 
I wanted to learn how coding in Unity works, how the engine itself if being handled.

This prototype became too complex for me at some point, so I decided to stop working on it, since it would require a ton of time to actually polish it in the end. Plus, with my full-time job it would be also too "demanding" of my spare time.
I used some free Unity assets from the Unity Store for 3D models, I used Claude Code to do code reviews, reworks of systems when I got stuck, plus some explanations of how things work in Unity.
